# edm_spotipy_project
Use spotipy to look up the top 5 popular songs of edm artists from a list of artists in a specified edm lineup


## TODO
- Set up html/css page on local server
- Ask user for lineup input (probably a copy-pasted list like in lineup pages)
- Input into get_artist_list()
    - Clean up code and rename to not just connection test!
    - MAYBE: Add genres to each output for future filtering
- Output its stuff back onto the webpage
- MAYBE: connect spotify account and add to some sort of playlist/queue?
- MAYBE: give option to filter by genre and/or popularity
